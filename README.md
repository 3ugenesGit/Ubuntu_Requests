# Ubuntu Image Fetcher

A Python tool for **mindfully collecting images from the web**, inspired by the Ubuntu principles of **Community, Respect, Sharing, and Practicality**.  

This script allows you to fetch one or more images from URLs, organize them in a dedicated folder, and avoid duplicates while handling errors gracefully.

- **Duplicate prevention** â†’ Skips files already downloaded by comparing image hashes.  
- **Organized storage** â†’ Saves images in a `Fetched_Images/` folder.  
- **Safe filenames** â†’ Extracts from URL or generates unique names if missing.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
